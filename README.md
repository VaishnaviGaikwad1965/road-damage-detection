# road-damage-detection
A deep learning project for classifying road surface damage using EfficientNet and PyTorch.


Implemented a Road Damage Detection project to identify and classify road conditions such as Linear Crack, Alligator Crack, Pothole, and Not Damaged using EfficientNet in PyTorch. A custom dataset was created with a 10% validation set to evaluate model accuracy. The project consists of Python scripts for data processing, model training, and inference, along with a .pth file containing the trained model weights. This work enables automatic detection of road damage from images, which can support road maintenance and monitoring, and includes clear documentation for replication and further development.


Road Damage Detection : 
Road Damage Detection is a project designed to automatically identify and classify road damage from images, helping in road maintenance planning and monitoring. It uses EfficientNet in PyTorch for accurate classification of road conditions.
